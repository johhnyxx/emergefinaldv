        Training is offered for those looking to lead Intimate Partner Abuse Education Program groups (formerly called BIP groups), and for those who are looking to learn more about how Emerge works with people who have abused their partner.
<br>
<br>
The two trainings present the same material and satisfy the 24-hour Massachusetts training requirement for group leaders.

      <h2>
        Founded in 1977, Emerge was the first abuser education program in the United States. Since its creation, Emerge has been a national leader in working to end violence in intimate relationships.
<br>
<br>
In working toward this goal, Emerge seeks to educate individual abusers, prevent young people from learning to accept violence in their relationships, improve institutional responses to domestic violence, and increase public awareness about the causes and solutions to partner violence. With the development of parenting education groups for fathers, Emerge has expanded its mission to include a goal of helping men to become more responsible parents.
